# TODO: Make Avatar Hand Movements Natural Like Human

## Tasks
- [x] Modify AvatarCanvas.tsx to replace sine-wave animations with natural, varied movements including randomness, idle fidgets, and expressive talking gestures.
- [x] Add subtle idle hand movements when not talking (e.g., occasional finger twitches, slight arm shifts).
- [x] Enhance talking animations with varied amplitudes, smoother transitions, and occasional expressive gestures.
- [ ] Test the updated animations in the browser to ensure they look natural and not over-animated.
